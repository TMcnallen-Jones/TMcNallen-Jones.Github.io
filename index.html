            <p>
                I started coding in secondary school, where as part of my computer science GCSE I had to learn how to code in Python and create a simple dice game program
                that met the listed requirements in time for a deadline. This was my first experience creating a project based on requirements and also creating one in time for a deadline.
                I learnt Unity and C# at home, which I then developed these two skills by making a game in A level, where I also learnt HTML, CSS and SQL. I have been expanding on
                these skills in university where I have studied and practiced working with C++, which we have used to make games in SFML. More recently, we have studied optimisation and OOP in directX.
                <br /><br />
                I have always loved programming and learning news ways to solve problems, giving me a deeper understanding of computers and the code I use. When I then found out I could
                combine my love for video games and programming by becoming a game developer, I knew this is what I wanted to do. I am determined to reach that goal no matter how much work it takes.

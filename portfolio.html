                              This is a project I made in the first year at university. It displays my skills in C++ using SFML to
                              create a 2D game. It was a project was made with requirements that I had to design. I was given a 15 week
                              a deadline to complete. I created documentation for the game design, technical design and then created multipe versions
                              using github.

                              This is a group project that was made with 6 people (including me). We had 2 designers, 2 programmers
                              and 2 artists in our group. In order to collaborate on this project, we managed our workflow with a
                              trello board, used github for version control and to allow us all to work on different sections. Finally,
                              we used discord to regularly update each other on our progress or communicate any difficulties that we ran into.

                              This is a wesbite I started in september 2023. I am using this as my portfolio to show off my best work. This website
                              has some of my best work, to showcase my skills as a progreammer. I will be working on this as I progress through
                              my career. From adding new projects, to adding new features that increase usability so that the site is as
                              appealing as possible!

                          <p>
                              This is a project I made in unreal to test my abilities at making features commonly found in an rpg. While these features
                              are commonly used in rpg's, they are also used in many other genres and AAA games. So I wanted to show my ability to create
                              such features. The date listed above is the last time I worked on it but I plan to work on it more as time goes on, so that
                              it can become more fully fleshed out and I can test my abilities on more features.

                              This is a project I made in directX using c++ to test and show my foundational knowledge of C++ and game development. The game is made in 2D,
                              however I chose to implement 3D elements for the menus to show off some 3D graphic knowledge and understanding. The date listed above is the last time I worked on it 
                              but I plan to add LUA support by April.

                          <p>
                              This is a project I made in unreal with a group (similar to the unity one) to test and demonstrate my teamworking abilities. 
                              With the help of github version control, trello board scheduling and regular meetings and discord communication. We were able
                              to make a basic survival game. The game itself has a lot of room to grow but we created it in a month with the intention of making
                              a prototype of the game. Thanks to the systems we put in place, expanding on this game would be quite easy with time. However, there 
                              are no current plans to do so. (This project is in the final stages of prototype development at the time of writing this so no images 
                              or videos can be shared)

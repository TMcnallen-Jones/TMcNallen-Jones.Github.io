                              This is a project I made in the first year at university. It displays my skills in C++ using SFML to 
                              create a 2D game. It was a project that had to follow requirements that I had to design and was given 
                              a deadline. I created documentation for the game design, technical design and then created multipe versions
                              using github.

                              This is a group project that was made with 6 people (including me). We had 2 designers, 2 programmers 
                              and 2 artists in our group. In order to collaborate on this project, we managed our workflow with a 
                              trello board, used github for version control and to allow us all to work on different sections and finally
                              used discord to regular communicate our progress or communicate any difficulties that were had.

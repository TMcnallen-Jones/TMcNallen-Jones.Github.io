                              This is a project I made in the first year at university. It displays my skills in C++ using SFML to 
                              create a 2D game. It was a project was made with requirements that I had to design. I was given a 15 week 
                              a deadline to complete. I created documentation for the game design, technical design and then created multipe versions
                              using github.

                              This is a group project that was made with 6 people (including me). We had 2 designers, 2 programmers 
                              and 2 artists in our group. In order to collaborate on this project, we managed our workflow with a 
                              trello board, used github for version control and to allow us all to work on different sections. Finally,
                              we used discord to regularly update each other on our progress or communicate any difficulties that we ran into.

                          This is a wesbite I started in september 2023. I am using this as my portfolio to show off my best work. This website
                          has some of my best work, to showcase my skills as a progreammer. I will be working on this as I progress through
                          my career. From adding new projects, to adding new features that increase usability so that the site is as
                          appealing as possible!
